### ToDo
- World of facts as in a godmap of facts - Blackboard
- Multiple sources to update the facts


- Facts to infer
    - Can we pour?
    - Does the current facts points to liquid spilled?
    - Is there an overflow?
    - What to do if there is a spilling or an overflow?

- Facts to consider before pouring
    - There is a source with liquid and a destination. Both the objects are within a distance (with the source objects length as diameter) that the source can be tilted to pour. This region is R
    - Initially, Source moves up --> IS: SPG - the goal of the source ends above the height of the destination with its opening facign upwards
    - Height of the destination < The source object has to be lifted to a height < Height of the destination + 5cm (?). IS : Above the periphery of Dest?
    - Held upright - with the opening facing upwards
    - The source can be tilted when there is no object between the source and destination or in that region R.
    - stop tilting when the opening of the source lies within the opening of the destination. Another SPG (IS) for tilting?
    - is the liquid pourable (e.g: honey is not pourable)
